	What Are We?

<p>
	The Compendium Project is an attempt to bring worldbuilders together into a community to facilitate cooperation, communication, and collaboration. The purpose of this website is to bring together people interested in building and developing their own fictional universes. By providing a robust platform of online worldbuilding tools, it is our hope that we can bring these creative minds together and serve as a forum to exchange ideas, receive feedback, and even collaborate on larger-scale worldbuilding projects.
